Eleanor dies and goes to the good place, that is what she is told at least. In reality, she came to a demon experiment to taunt humans before sending them to hell.

The Architect of the good place starts wondering if any humans can even get to heaven, and whether the good place can be used to help humans to go to heaven.

A very funny comedy worth binging for sure!
