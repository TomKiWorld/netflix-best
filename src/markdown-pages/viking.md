If I have to pick my number one, it would be Vikings!

Ragnar Lothbrok, starts as a farmer and becomes the leader of the Vikings. Leading them to victorious battles conquering and discovering new lands in Europe and beyond. Even though he is the main charcter he is definitely not the only one. 
His wife Lagertha plays a big role as a Viking Shield maiden. Fearless and determined, she leads many battles alongside Ragnar and on her own.
His sons Bj√∂rn Ironside and Ivar the Boneless grow up to be mighty warriors and the plot thickens some more.

During six seasons full of action and surprises, you get a glimpse of a time long ago from the perspective of the fearless Vikings from the cold north.
