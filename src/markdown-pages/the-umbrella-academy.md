In October 1989 43 women around the world give birth without ever being pregnant.

A rich man adopts 6 of these children, each of them gifted with abilities.

As kids they are trained by their adopting father to help fight crime, which makes them hate him in the process.

17 years later, after his death, they are joined again and the story of crime fighting starts once again.
