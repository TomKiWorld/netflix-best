Lucifer decides to leave hell and relocate to LA after millennia of being the Lord of Hell. He opens a nightclub and gets involved with a Police detective.

He uses his slick talk and his powers to get the truth out of suspects, helping the police as a consultant. Meanwhile hell has no Lord and other Angels and Demons come to LA to get their way.
