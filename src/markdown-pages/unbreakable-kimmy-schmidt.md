Kimmy Schmidt is rescued after spending 15 years in an underground shelter with three other women and a man telling them the world outside has ended.

After leaving the bunker, she moves to New York to reclaim her life. She shares an appartment with Titus, a gay wannabe Broadway actor, and a crazy land lord.

Her naitivity and positivity communicating with people make day to day encounters transform into hilarious moments.
